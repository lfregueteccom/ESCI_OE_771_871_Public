    "Keplerian motion is the motion of **satellites** in their orbits. Satellites can be artificial and placed in an orbit or can be celestial. In both cases satellite motion is the motion of one object around another and is strongly dependent on the gravitational attraction between them. Johannes Kepler developed three laws of planetary motion around the sun in the early 17th century. At the end of the 17th century Newton showed that Kepler's laws are consistent with the law of universal gravitation and laws of motion. This makes that the Kepler's laws may be used to model satellite orbital motion with sufficient accuracy to determine satellite positions. Note that for timing relativistic effects come into play, which is a subject outside the scope of this course.\n",

    "The first two of Kepler's laws may be combined to calculate the position of satellites for a given epoch. The combination of the first two laws creates Kepler's equation that allows the position determination of the satellite in polar coordinates with their origin at the center of the body that they orbit. In the case of **GPS** that is the center of the reference frame defined by **WGS84**. The position of the satellite is then a function of time since being in a given location of the orbit. The reference used by Kepler's laws is the **perigee**, that is the location at which the satellite is closest to earth. The angle $\\nu$ describing the position is known as the **true anomaly** $\\nu$ and is the angle from the perigee increasing in the direction of the satellite motion.\n",

These steps are divided in a number of smaller steps. All of these steps are implemented in the `gnss.get_single_epoch_ephemeris_from_gps_nav()` method. Note that the implementation of the method is based on the paper [Computing satellite velocity using the broadcast ephemeris](../Documentation/Remondi2004_Article_ComputingSatelliteVelocityUsin.pdf) by Ben Remondi(2004). In the mean time an improved modeling method has been published which is finding general acceptance; This method is found in the paper [Computing GPS Satellite Velocity and Acceleration from the Broadcast Navigation Message](../Documentation/GPS-SV-velocity-and-acceleration.pdf) by Thompson, et al.

The return data `eph` consist of matrix with the number of rows matching the number of satellites for which data are available. The data used in this step are from the GPS broadcast ephemeris, that is the data that the GPS svs transmit while in orbit. Given that we are dealing with a virtual receiver we do not have the capability to actually receive these data. Fortunately these data are however stored at the various gnss data centers around the world, including the NASA repository used for this assignment. The `GNSS.add_next_epoch_ephemeris()` automatically retrieves these data for GPS and stores them in a `RINEX_nav` object. The `RINEX_nav` class was specifically created to be able to read and hold the broadcast ephemeris data that is disseminated in the *Receiver Independent Exchange Format* (**RINEX**) navigation files. In case of GPS broadcast data these are the Keplerian elements needed to calculate the position of the svs. Much like the precise ephemeris files you analyzed in step 2 the data is organized in epochs and given for each PRN (You will find a RINEX format description in the documentation). You can determine the number of satellites by counting the PRN identifiers for the `RINEX_nav` object `gps_nav` holding the data.\n",

    "For the day of our epoch we will cycle through all of the satellites whose data are contained in the broadcast ephemeris file. The `RINEX_nav` object `gps_nav` holds a list of records containing the orbit parameters for each satellite at different epochs, these records are contained in the list `gps_nav.records`. These records are `structured arrays` which are data records in which the fields may be addressed by name. You will notice that in the file `rinex_nav.py` there is the definition of the `gps_d_type`. This `gps_d_type` is then the structure that can hold the data associated to the broadcast ephemeris. If you look at the definition of the RINEX navigation data structure (included in the documents section) you will see that the parameters match the contents of a GPS navigation message.\n",

This means that pairs $x_{i}=x_{j}$ with $y_{i}\\neq y_{j}$ are not allowed, which is desirable as no interpolation function $L$ such that $y_i = L(x_i)$ would exist; a function can only get one value for each argument $x_i$. On the other hand, if also $y_i = y_j$, then those two points would actually be one single point, but still lead to failure in the interpolation method due to the division by zero.\n",

    "In other words, all basis polynomials are zero at $x = x_j$, except $ℓ_j\\cdot (x)$, for which it holds that $ℓ_j(x_j) = 1$, because it lacks the $(x−x_j)$ term.\n",

    "It follows that $y_j\\cdot ℓ_j\\cdot(x_j)=y_j$, so at each point $x_j,L(x_j)=y_j+0+0+⋯+0=y_j$, showing that $L$ interpolates the function exactly.\n",

    "Note that the formulation of the **Lagrange basis polynomials** implies that to be able to fit functions of order $n$ we need $n+1$ samples i.e., for a linear function we require 2 samples, a quadratic function 3 samples, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that as more samples are used the higher the order of the **Lagrange basis polynomials** is. This may lead to numerical issues for large sampling sets rendering the results to be unstable. For larger data sets it is therefore often better to creating a moving window for the interpolation. The size of the window can be bigger if the data is smoother. For GNNS ephemeris data we often use a window of 6 samples, that is we use a polynomial fit order of $6-1=5$\n",
